Simulator for dropping/flinging an object off of a ferris wheel onto a moving cart target. Every relevant parameter is modifiable,
so accurate results and experiments can be reproduced. There is also a cinematic camera during the drop, and confetti when it is successfully dropped in,
just to add a bit of flar and make it a bit more fun to use.

Created by Kai Dodson of Compact Square Studios for use at Chadwick School.
